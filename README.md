# Welcome To My C Learning Repository!

## About Me
My name is Brandon Cintron, and I'm a Computer Science student at the University of Central Florida. As of 02/18/2025, I have about one years' worth of experience with C through courses such as Harvard CS50, COP-3223, and individual learning projects. I like to spend my free time learning programming and getting better.

## About The Repository
I've created this repository to display my journey of learning C as a Computer Science student while also utilizing the Git workflow. It's also so you can have an understanding of how much I know about C. My goal is to commit to this repository daily, and learn new things each time.

This repository will contain as many aspects of the C language that I discover, including the basics like arrays, functions, structs, along with advanced topics such as data structures, algorithms, and pointers as I progress. The problems in this repository will mainly come from Professor Guha's COP 3223 archive and other resources I discover.
