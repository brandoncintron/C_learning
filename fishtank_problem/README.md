# Fishtank - Practice Problem

*DISCLAIMER: This practice problem was referenced from a University of Central Florida professors' public practice resources. __I do not take any credit for creating this problem, nor can I guarantee my program is the most efficient.__*

## Problem 
You want to build a goldfish tank and determine how much it will cost. Each tank has three dimensions: length, width and height. The cost of building the tank is simply the cost of the five panes of glass that comprise the tank. (The top of the tank is not enclosed by glass.) Glass costs exactly $0.02 for one square inch. Define a constant to store this value in your program. Your program should prompt the user for the length, width and height of the tank in inches. Then your program should calculate the cost of building the tank and output that to the screen.

## Input Specification
1. The length, width and height of the tank will be positive integers.

## Output Specification
Output the cost in dollars to build the fish tank to two decimal places.

## Example Usage

```
Example 1:
What is the length of your goldfish tank (in inches)?: 24
What is the width of your goldfish tank (in inches)?: 12
What is the height of your goldfish tank (in inches)?: 16
Your goldfish tank costs $28.80 to build.
```

```
Example 2:
What is the length of your goldfish tank (in inches)?: 40
What is the width of your goldfish tank (in inches)?: 20 
What is the height of your goldfish tank (in inches)?: 20
Your goldfish tank costs $64.00 to build.
