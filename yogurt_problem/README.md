# Yogurt - Practice Problem

*DISCLAIMER: This practice problem was referenced from a University of Central Florida professors' public practice resources. __I do not take any credit for creating this problem, nor can I guarantee my program is the most efficient.__*

## Problem 
Arup often takes his step-daughter to Menchie’s, a place that serves frozen yogurt. Unfortunately, his wife has put the two of them on a fixed budget for frozen yogurt. In addition, he insists that since his step-daughter is smaller than he, he must get some multiple more frozen yogurt than she gets. (For example, if the multiple is 1.5 and she gets 2 oz. of yogurt, then he will get 3 oz.) The price of frozen yogurt at Menchie’s is 49 cents/ounce plus tax. For the purposes of this program, assume a 6.5% sales tax rate. (In reality, tax gets rounded up to the nearest penny, but don’t worry about this detail for this problem.) Write a program to determine how many ounces of yogurt both Arup and his step-daughter can get. In your program, prompt the user to enter the following two items:

1) The total amount of cash Arup has for the Menchie’s visit.
2) The ratio of yogurt that Arup receives to what his step-daughter receives.

## Input Specification
Both input values will be real numbers in between 1 and 20.

## Output Specification
Output will be rounded to two decimal places.


## Example Usage

```
Example:

How many dollars do you have for frozen yogurt?: 6.5
What is the ratio of yogurt that you’ll get compared to your child?: 1.5
You will get 7.44 ounces of yogurt.
Your child will get 4.96 ounces of yogurt.
